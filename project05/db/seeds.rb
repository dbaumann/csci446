:title => "Top 5 Architectural Design Software Products",
:author_name => "Dan Fargo",
:body => <<HERE
If you are browsing for an architectural design software to begin redesigning your potential residence, or likely to guide you with your college works, the subsequent guide may help one to make a good choice concerning the perfect architectural design software to suit your needs.

Even while I was student in architecture, I used to be pretty confused with the options which i had at that time. It was 2003 and my second year, so as everyone learned a software, I needed to pick one myself. After researching like crazy thru forums, and talking to my colleagues I began to use Archicad, since it seemed the most effective fit for what we had to do... That appeared to work fine, until I needed to develop more complicated 3D objects, also to rotate them easily... During those times, Archicad was a bit dumber in that area, so I switched to Allplan, and stayed with it ever since.

Enough, about me, let's talk about what can be your options today, as the current market in architectural design software is a whole lot more diverse than a several years back.

1. ArchiCAD

The primary recommendation I have for rookies, is ArchiCAD, and that is as this software, was, but still is among the most intuitive ones with regards to producing and adjusting floor plans in my view. What meaning, is that if you're a young architect or designer you can easily discover the most significant commands and use them immediately to digitally draw whatever you want. You can also obtain a free trial version for the software.

2. Chief Architect

Is actually a professional 3D architectural home design software. It includes a built in automated building tools to make home design, remodeling, interior design and kitchen & bath design as simple as it gets. You can find why Chief Architect could be the home design software software product of preference for 2D and 3D design for a lot of US architects. This software also has an free trial offer, so if you think this can be a better suited option, give it a shot.

3. Punch Software

Self intitled America's #1 Home & Landscape Design Software, this application combines the power of NexGen with the stunning realism of photographic quality from LightWorks, enabling you to create realistic home designs yourself, or for your customers. You can check it on their official page.

4. Autocad Architecture

AutoCAD Architecture software program is the package of AutoCAD designed for architects. Features developed for architectural drafting help you build designs and documents more effectively, inside the familiar AutoCAD environment. Certainly, you can try this one too before you buy it.

5. Vectorworks Architect

This is my personal favorite, and I left it towards the end, simply because is quite complex, and although it's difficult to sit and learn your way around it, the program will deliver fast and extraordinary results after you have used it for some time. But as I was saying, this is for tech nerds, and in all likelihood not really the first option for a newbie.

This group of architectural designs software should supply you with a basic guidance regarding what is available today out there and what you could buy for your future designs.

:title => "Offshore Software Outsourcing",
:author_name => "Rakhee Chowdhary",
:body => <<HERE
Offshore software application development outsourcing has led to vegetative industry growth around the globe. Software needs to undergo a step-by-step process before it is available for general use to leverage best industry practices at minimum cost, meeting international standards and industry norms. Nowadays, everyone of us, an individual or an enterprise wants to be at the top, but just gaining the top positioning won't do; retaining and maintaining that position is of utmost consideration. Outsourcing software applications to offshore companies has strong impulse to monetize spending of business players.

Software outsourcing gathered strength with increasing number of sources available in present IT-edge, requirements delivery in possible least time, less skilled personnel available, discrete communication and inefficient management of various modules within a large enterprise. These corporate players started looking and relying on third party for better management at lesser cost and remain competitive in the global marketplace. These are the few factors that led big companies to outsource their software application development to offshore companies where they find time zone difference from eastern countries most attractive, cheaper human capital, rich resources, and skilled professional and low processes cost. Market analysis shows gradual penetration of investors in Indian market and other developing countries. We find increased productive, managed easy solutions where full control remains in the hand of outsourcing companies.

40% of the Fortune 500 companies including GE, Lucent, Oracle, Microsoft, Motorola are leveraging the outsourcing model. The list is growing depending upon the onsite and the outsource resources available. Offshore Software Outsourcing is the most leading area of outsourcing. Cost saving by adopting this model can vary from 40% to 70%.

Manipulating overall strategy (considering failure and success) we find overall the offshore outsourcing campaign is a success. Objective is to maximize the ROI, remain competitive and reduce upbringing cost.

Remember offshoring software outsourcing is not always the solution, so before moving to it, the best approach is to find the niche requirement and then find solution to the root problem. Proper synchronization between onshore and offshore team members, improved processes, and better time management and growth opportunities for both developed and developing countries are among few benefits that offshore software outsourcing companies are enjoying.

:title => "The Impact of Packaging on the Environment",
:author_name => "Allie Woodrow",
:body => <<HERE
The impact of packaging on the environment is of increasing concern to manufacturers and consumers alike. There are several factors that impact how green packaging is, including any regulations required, if any emissions are created in the manufacturing of the packaging that might impact on the environment, any waste that will be produced and what will be done with that waste, and the feeling of consumers.

Governments across the world have set down regulations for manufacturers to ensure the packaging they create has as little impact on the environment as possible. In the production of packaging, emissions like Co2 are created. Too much and it can harm the environment. Manufacturers are required to keep emissions as low as they can. It is also expected that packaging will be kept to as low a weight and small a size as it needs to be. This also has an impact on the environment in terms of the amount of fuel used for transportation.

The disposal of packaging and the environment is also a key issue. Manufacturers have to consider what will happen to packaging when it is no longer needed. There is an increase in the use of packaging that can be recycled, like cardboard, paper or glass. For packaging that cannot be recycled, it often has to go to a landfill site. Governments place restrictions on manufacturers to ensure the amount of material being sent to landfill is kept as low as possible.

Manufacturers often have to take into consideration the desire of consumers, who increasingly want to reduce the amount of household waste as possible and reduce their impact on the environment. Households are expected to recycle an increasing amount of their waste, therefore they are much more likely to turn to manufacturers of goods like food and drink, cleaning items etc. to ensure their packaging has as little of an impact on the environment as possible.

Companies who use environmentally friendly packaging often use this as a marketing tool to make themselves more attractive to consumers. For example, Kenco Coffee's recent advertising campaign recently focused on the fact they had reduced the amount of packaging being used. Similarly, an important part of the Fair Trade brand is that many of their products are distributed in recyclable packaging. This makes consumers who are concerned about their own impact on the environment much more likely to buy their product. Similarly, reusable packaging is attractive to buyers as it reduces the need for packaging.

:title => "How to Find Awesome Creative People",
:author_name => "Nigel Collin",
:body => <<HERE
If you are going to boost the creative performance of your business and become a thought leader in your industry you need to tap into and utilize the talents of very clever, innovative and creative people.

To do that, one question that surfaces is, where do you find great creative people? Especially ones who are going to contribute to your business?

More often than not the impulse for a leader is look out into the world and find ways and means of attracting the very best people to suit their business, and who are aligned with their purpose, people who are extraordinarily good at what they do, people who they can inspire to be more creative by providing the best resources, culture and leadership so that these creative people can in turn provide truly creative and innovative solutions that drive a business forward.

Which is great and needs to be done. However...

Let me propose that some of the best creative people you could possibly hope to find are already in your business and you may not even know they are there. All you need to do is be open enough to look for them, listen out for them, and start finding ways to encourage them to come forward.

How do you recognize them? Some could be those shy, demure types who every so often illuminate proceedings with an insightful observation that changes everything. Some are those maverick types who constantly push the envelope with crazy ideas and schemes, and some are those sensible intellectual types, who are constantly learning and gathering information so they can contribute in amazing ways. There is no common look or handshake but they all want to express themselves, be heard, contribute and be part of something bigger than themselves.

The point is creative people come in all shapes and sizes and can be found on all levels of an organization and are all extremely valuable to your business. They can help you disrupt the market and outpace your competitors, drive innovation, solve problems, find opportunities, streamline processes and reinvent the wheel if needed. In short they can help your business move forward and be more profitable if your let them.

I believe it's also the responsibility of an organization's leadership to find them and seek them out and create an environment, which encourages and stimulates them and gives them permission to be creative and help them be the best creative people they can be.

Nigel Collin helps businesses lead the creativity and thinking of their people. He has a knack for creating synergy between creative people and business outcomes. Fortunately he is able to teach this to others. With genuine knowledge and experience on the frontline working with both creative people and business leaders, Nigel understands how to bring creativity to life in an organization and achieve commercial value.

:title => "Getting Investors to Notice Your Business",
:author_name => "Joseph Lizio",
:body => <<HERE
For some businesses, private equity (venture capital, angel capital, SBIC) is the only way to go for growth funding while other businesses should not even consider wasting their time chasing these kinds of funding sources.

Private equity players receive hundreds, if not thousands, of business plans each month. And, no matter how big the firm, there is just no way they will be able to review all of those plans. As former President George H.W. Bush was found of saying; "Not gonna happen."

Even if the business seeking funding is the perfect match for the investment firm, it still remains highly unlikely that its business plan will get any consideration from just merely cold sending a business plan to one of the managing partners.

So, how can you get these investors to stand up and take notice of your business?

By simply getting an introduction.

Now, this does not mean having your Aunt Sally call the investment firm with a recommendation regarding your business. It means getting a recommendation from someone who the investors have either worked with in the past or trusts fully.

Example, several years ago, I was the Executive Director of a small business incubator in Texas. One of our client companies was quickly burning though its cash and decided to seek another round of outside investment. After searching high and low for months, one of the original founders got in contact with an old college chum who happened to have dealings with a very prominent venture capitalist in the state (a VC that the company had tried to approach many times in the past via cold calling with out any success).

The venture capitalist not only knew this old college chum but trusted his insight and judgment. Within a few weeks, this VC invested $2.5 million in the company; allowing the business to quickly ramp up sales and eventually become a huge success.

Now, not all of us have old college friends that are that well connected. But, that does not have to stop you. All you have to do, instead of wasting valuable time sending cold solicitations to private investment firms, is to spend that time identifying and contacting those people who the investor or investors trusts - called gatekeepers.

What? That seems even harder to do than just finding an investor for your business. And, you are right. But, it is how the game is played and you either have to play along or get left behind.

There are several ways to identify these gatekeepers:

Seek out other professionals in your local area - particularly those in your industry. These could be CPAs, Attorneys or other business owners. Investors also use these professional's services and trust these people or have worked with these firms in the past.

College professors are also a good source for an introduction to investors. Many college professors, especially those that come from private industry prior to becoming teachers, have huge rolodexes. The key is to get them to use those contacts for the benefit of your business.

Local Networking. Many Chamber of Commerce administrators or representatives, City Officials or other local business professionals in your area may have contracts in the private investment space and may be willing to help introduce your company to them. This involves just getting out in your community and attending events that both investors and gatekeepers attend and talking to anyone and everyone. Don't be afraid to ask for an introduction or to pitch your business.

Portfolio Companies. Look to companies that the investors you are targeting have already invested in - in the past or presently. Seek out these companies' founders and executives, attempt to build a relationship with them then ask for an introduction.

Remember, the goal is to get a solid introduction from a trusted source. So, do your homework and just simply get after it as you have a much better chance of getting your business plan moved to the top of the pile after an introduction from a trusted gatekeeper then wasting time cold soliciting investors directly.

Also know that raising money is just a single step in growing a solid business. Thus while none of us like to put ourselves out there in this manner - when you look back, you will see that this was a very minimal step in the overall growth and success of your business.

So, what are you waiting for? If you want investors to notice your business then get out there and network for that very important introduction.

Once your mind starts to believe it, it's only a matter of time before the rest of you catches up.

:title => "Fishing in Bermuda",
:author_name => "Pallavi Sri Kant",
:body => <<HERE
If you enjoy fishing, then Bermuda is definitely the best holiday destination for you. The climate in Bermuda is incredible making it very relaxing for all boating lovers. There is no permit required and hence fishing too becomes an awesome experience. You could be hunting blue marlin, barracuda, bonefish and other wide varieties of fish once you have hired a fishing boat. May to November is the best time to arrange for a vacation in Bermuda since you could see many species of fish that migrate through this Island. You could look out for cheap tickets during this season when you cannot only enjoy the beautiful sun, and blue sea.

Fishing is most preferred by most tourists and unless you own a boat in Bermuda it is always better to look forward to chartering boats for half a day or for a full day, and you can order per individual or a group depending on your preference. But the local laws mandate that only licensed captains should be taking care of the fishing boats. Most of the charters are linked up with the resorts and this makes it simple to find a charter. But most of the fishing charters are really expensive and hence it would be preferable if you can build up a group with whom you can share the expenses. It is also a good practice to know if they have to share some of their catch, and also be familiar with other local policies.

Reel Addiction, Ovenproof, Shake Down Charters, De Mako, Playmate Fishing Charters, Sea Scorpion are some of the well-known charters. Bermuda is well-known for Shore Fishing, Reef Fishing and Deep Sea Fishing. Bonefish, pompano, grey snapper and great barracuda fish are usual catch in Shore Fishing with the Great Sound in western Bermuda and the harbor in St Georges Parish being good locations for shore fishing. Barracuda, yellowtail snapper, Bermuda chub, little tunny, grey snapper, coney, grey triggerfish, and lane snapper being ideal for Reef Fishing with Bermuda Shoreline and Argus Bank being ideal locations for reef fishing. Atlantic blue marlin, wahoo, great amberjack, skipjack tuna, blackfin tuna, white marlin, yellowfin tuna, rainbow runner, almaco jack, great barracuda, and little tunny are hubs for deep sea fishing. There is Hamilton Harbour for people who don't like to go too deep in Deep Sea Fishing which also promises good catch. Bermuda fishing is fast emerging as a favorite sport and most desired for vacation.

Fishing is one of the most adventurous activity performed during vacation. Bermuda being one of the most exciting fishing vacation, people keep looking for cheap tickets to that place. You can read more about vacation and vacation planning in my other articles.

:title => "Sea Kayaking in Scotland",
:author_name => "Andreas Heinzl",
:body => <<HERE
The west coast of the Scottish Highlands has many inlets, sea Lochs (Fjords) and sea cliffs. Many consider this as an ideal place for sea kayaking. Even though the weather can sometimes play tricks with you while out on water it is still an adventure not to be missed. In many cases people are now looking for an adventure and an exploration of remote almost untouched places.

Some of the most famous places ideal for paddling are the Isle of Skye and the Summer Isles. There are also other places to venture to. Knoydart is one of the most remote places in mainland UK and is easiest to be reached by water. Using a sea kayak which you can load with food and equipment of up to 50kg can make a difference when you spend a few days in the wilds. Just imagine how much someone can carry in a rucksack!

In case you don't have the experience to go kayaking on your own there are many outdoor activity providers running trips in the Highlands of Scotland. Kayaking coaches in the United Kingdom are mostly well experienced in teaching and leading a group of people in local waters. Some outfits offer bespoke trips and/or fixed programmes. Not many however, harness one great advantage of sea kayaking, which is getting to remote places. Why not paddle into a remote area like Knoydart and explore the place for a few days? This is certainly what paddling in the sea in meant to be for.

:title => "Basic Home Brew How To",
:author_name => "Josh B Smith",
:body => <<HERE
Look at the number of different brand names and variations of beer that are now being offered for sale today. Don't forget all of the different types of international beer. You can learn and perfect this system and turn out to be a brew master in your own home.

The process of beer brewing is somewhat straight forward, however developing a great beer definitely requires a large amount of practice. Listed here are the basics of home brewing beer:

1. Sanitation and cleanliness is really essential. Sanitize, sanitize, sanitize. This could not be overemphasized. Carefully wash and sterilize every single component of the fermenting and brewing gear before starting. Bacteria thrives in fermenting beer. This could spoil your beer or simply generate some undesirable flavors. Worst case, it may make you sick.

2. Follow the instructions and measure diligently. Pick the recipe and stick to the instructions and measurements accurately.

3. Mix: In a large cooking pot, boil the wort. At this stage, you can expect to add the hops, moss, and malt, as well as any other ingredients your recipe needs. Always make sure you possess the proper ingredients prior to starting. Almost all recipes call for boiling water as the starting point, followed by the inclusion of some other ingredients. Making use of the proper ingredients in the right amounts, and putting them in the correct order, can make a huge difference to your beer.

4. Cool the wort: Right after you're finished combining and boiling the wort, you will need to cool it quickly. When it's cooling down, your wort could be exposed to undesirable bacteria. Cooling it quickly will help lessen the chance of any undesirable bacteria getting into the wort. Placing the pot in a sink full of cold water can achieve this. After it has cooled off, you can expect to insert the yeast along with any outstanding components. The wort is put right into a fermenting container. It will stay here for a few weeks to ferment. Different kinds of beer require diverse fermenting times as well as temperatures, so make sure to stick to the recipes very carefully.

5. Bottle the beer: As soon as the fermenting process is finished, pour your beer into cleaned and sanitized containers. The beer should stay in these containers for a couple of weeks in order to carbonate as well as condition.

Your home brewed beer should now be ready to consume.

After you have learned the fundamentals of beer making, you'll find it's an easy process that you can excel at in your home. After you have perfected your skills along with your recipes, you will never want to return to commercialized brews ever again.

:body => <<HERE
"We can't drill and burn our way out of our economic and ecological ills, but we can invent and invest our way out", says Van Jones, the author of The Green Collar Economy and founder of Green for All.

This guy doesn't need my help nor do I get any consideration for recommending this book. But this is a thoughtful straight forward view of how we can help the economy, create jobs, and retool America to get out of this economic slump while repairing the environment. That's an incredible task and often encompassing goals that seem contradictory. But it's do-able! There is hardly anything these days that is more important or has more far reaching effects on each of us who live on the "third rock from the sun". We are all citizens of a global community. What happens to one of us good or bad, affects the rest of us. Check this book out. It is informative, thoughtful and I think you'll find it eye opening just how simple the solution is to getting our efforts headed in an effective and more appropriate manner.

You'll find it a very educational and entertaining read. No matter how you voted in the recent election, it was very clear that the large majority of us were ripe for change. We have all seen how our daily lives have been effected by the environment, poor decisions and lack of responsiveness over the last few years. Nobody can deny we need some changes. Van Jones shows us how our goals to provide an better place to live, more jobs, security for our families and save the environment are all goals that can be accomplished together without sacrificing one over another.

The Green Collar Economy by Van Jones available on Amazon.com and bookstores everywhere
